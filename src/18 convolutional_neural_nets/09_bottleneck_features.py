# How to extract bottleneck features
# Modern CNNs can take weeks to train on multiple GPUs on ImageNet, but fortunately, many researchers share their final
# weights. Keras, e.g., contains pre-trained models for several of the reference architectures discussed above, namely
# VGG16 and 19, ResNet50, InceptionV3 and InceptionResNetV2, MobileNet, DenseNet, NASNet and MobileNetV2
# This notebook illustrates how to download pre-trained VGG16 model, either with the final layers to generate predictions
# or without the final layers as illustrated in the figure below to extract the outputs produced by the bottleneck features.

    ## Load and Preprocess Sample Images
    # Before supplying an image to a pre-trained network in Keras, there are some required preprocessing steps.
    # We have imported a very small dataset of 7
    # images and stored the  preprocessed image input as `img_input`.  Note that the dimensionality of this array is
    # `(8, 224, 224, 3)`.  In this case, each of the 8 images is a 3D tensor, with shape `(224, 224, 3)`.

        # convert PIL.Image.Image type to 3D tensor with shape (224, 224, 3)
        x = image.img_to_array(img)
        # convert 3D tensor to 4D tensor with shape (1, 224, 224, 3) and return 4D tensor

    ## Import Pre-Trained VGG-16
    # Import the VGG-16 network (including the final classification layer) that has been pre-trained on ImageNet.

    # Keras makes it very straightforward to download and use pre-trained models:
    vgg16 = VGG16()
    vgg16.summary()

    # For this network, `model.predict` returns a 1000-dimensional probability vector containing the predicted
    # probability that an image returns each of the 1000 ImageNet categories.  The dimensionality of the obtained output
    # from passing `img_input` through the model is `(8, 1000)`.  The first value of `7` merely denotes that 7 images
    # were passed through the network.
    y_pred = vgg16.predict(img_input)
    print(y_pred.shape)
    print(np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1))

    ## Import the VGG-16 Model, with the Final Fully-Connected Layers Removed
    # When performing transfer learning, we need to remove the final layers of the network, as they are too specific
    # to the ImageNet database.  This is accomplished in the code cell below.
    # ![VGG-16 model for transfer learning](images/vgg19_transfer.png)

    # You can use this model like any other Keras model for predictions. To exclude the fully-connected layers, just add
    # the keyword `include_top=False` to obtain the output of the final convolutional layer when passing an image to the CNN.
    vgg16 = VGG16(include_top=False)
    vgg16.summary()

    # By omitting the fully-connected layers, we are no longer forced to use a fixed input size for the model
    # (224x224, the original ImageNet format). By only keeping the convolutional modules, our model can be adapted to
    # arbitrary input sizes.

    ### Extract Output of Final Max Pooling Layer
    # Now, the network stored in `model` is a truncated version of the VGG-16 network, where the final three
    # fully-connected layers have been removed.  In this case, `model.predict` returns a 3D array (with dimensions
    # $7\times 7\times 512$) corresponding to the final max pooling layer of VGG-16.  The dimensionality of the obtained
    # output from passing `img_input` through the model is `(8, 7, 7, 512)`.  The first value of `8` merely denotes that
    # 8 images were passed through the network.
    print(vgg16.predict(img_input).shape)

    # This is exactly how we calculate the bottleneck features for your project!

    ## Import ResNet50
    ### With final layer
    resnet = ResNet50()
    resnet.summary()

    ### Without final layer
    resnet = ResNet50(include_top=False)
    resnet.summary()

    ## Import Inception V3
    ### With final layer
    inception = InceptionV3()
    inception.summary()

    ### Without final layer
    inception = InceptionV3(include_top=False)
    inception.summary()
