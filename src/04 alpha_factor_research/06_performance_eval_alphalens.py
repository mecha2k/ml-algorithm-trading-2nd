# # Separating signal and noise â€“ how to use alphalens
# Quantopian has open sourced the Python library, alphalens, for the performance analysis of predictive stock factors
# that integrates well with the backtesting library zipline and the portfolio performance and risk analysis library
# pyfolio that we will explore in the next chapter.
# alphalens facilitates the analysis of the predictive power of alpha factors concerning the:
# - Correlation of the signals with subsequent returns
# - Profitability of an equal or factor-weighted portfolio based on a (subset of) the signals
# - Turnover of factors to indicate the potential trading costs
# - Factor-performance during specific events
# - Breakdowns of the preceding by sector
#
# The analysis can be conducted using tearsheets or individual computations and plots.
# > This notebook requires the `conda` environment `backtest`. Please see the [installation instructions]
# (../installation/README_quantopian.md) for running the latest Docker image or alternative ways to set up your environment.

## Creating forward returns and factor quantiles
# To utilize `alpahalens`, we need to provide signals for a universe of assets like those returned by the ranks
# of the MeanReversion factor, and the forward returns earned by investing in an asset for a given holding period.
# This notebook uses the file `single_factor.pickle` with the results generated in the notebook
# `single_factor_zipline.ipynb` in this directory.
# We will recover the prices from the `single_factor.pickle` file as follows (`factor_data` accordingly):

performance = pd.read_pickle("../data/single_factor.pkl")
performance.info()

prices = pd.concat([df.to_frame(d) for d, df in performance.prices.dropna().items()], axis=1).T
prices.columns = [re.findall(r"\[(.+)]", str(col))[0] for col in prices.columns]
prices.index = prices.index.normalize()
prices.info()

factor_data = pd.concat(
    [df.to_frame(d) for d, df in performance.factor_data.dropna().items()], axis=1
).T
factor_data.columns = [re.findall(r"\[(.+)]", str(col))[0] for col in factor_data.columns]
factor_data.index = factor_data.index.normalize()
factor_data = factor_data.stack()
factor_data.index.names = ["date", "asset"]
print(factor_data.head())

with pd.HDFStore("../data/assets.h5") as store:
    sp500 = store["sp500/stooq"].close
sp500 = sp500.resample("D").ffill().tz_localize("utc").filter(prices.index.get_level_values(0))
print(sp500.head())

# We can create the alphalens input data in the required format using the `get_clean_factor_and_forward_returns`
# utility function that also returns the signal quartiles and the forward returns for the given holding periods:
HOLDING_PERIODS = (5, 10, 21, 42)
QUANTILES = 5
alphalens_data = get_clean_factor_and_forward_returns(
    factor=factor_data, prices=prices, periods=HOLDING_PERIODS, quantiles=QUANTILES
)
print(alphalens_data.head())

# The `alphalens_data` `DataFrame` contains the returns on an investment in the given asset on a given date for
# the indicated holding period, as well as the factor value, that is, the asset's `MeanReversion` ranking on
# that date, and the corresponding quantile value:
alphalens_data.reset_index().head().to_csv("../data/factor_data.csv", index=False)

# The forward returns and the signal quantiles are the basis for evaluating the predictive power of the signal.
# Typically, a factor should deliver markedly different returns for distinct quantiles, such as negative returns
# for the bottom quintile of the factor values and positive returns for the top quantile.
create_summary_tear_sheet(alphalens_data)

## Predictive performance by factor quantiles -  Returns Analysis
# As a first step, we would like to visualize the average period return by factor quantile. We can use the built-in
# function mean_return_by_quantile from the performance and plot_quantile_returns_bar from the plotting modules
mean_return_by_q, std_err = mean_return_by_quantile(alphalens_data)
mean_return_by_q_norm = mean_return_by_q.apply(lambda x: x.add(1).pow(1 / int(x.name[:-1])).sub(1))

## Mean Return by Holding Period and Quintile
# The result is a bar chart that breaks down the mean of the forward returns for the four different holding
# periods based on the quintile of the factor signal. As you can see, the bottom quintiles yielded markedly
# more negative results than the top quintiles, except for the longest holding period:
plot_quantile_returns_bar(mean_return_by_q)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig("images/06-01.png", bboxinches="tight")

# The 10D holding period provides slightly better results for the first and fourth quartiles. We would also
# like to see the performance over time of investments driven by each of the signal quintiles.
# We will calculate daily, as opposed to average returns for the 5D holding period, and alphalens will adjust
# the period returns to account for the mismatch between daily signals and a longer holding period
# (for details, see docs):
mean_return_by_q_daily, std_err = mean_return_by_quantile(alphalens_data, by_date=True)

## Cumulative 5D Return
# The resulting line plot shows that, for most of this three-year period, the top two quintiles significantly
# outperformed the bottom two quintiles. However, as suggested by the previous plot, signals by the fourth quintile
# produced a better performance than those by the top quintile
plot_cumulative_returns_by_quantile(mean_return_by_q_daily["5D"], period="5D", freq=None)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig("images/06-02.png", bboxinches="tight")

## Return Distribution by Holding Period and Quintile
# This distributional plot highlights that the range of daily returns is fairly wide and, despite different means,
# the separation of the distributions is very limited so that, on any given day, the differences in performance
# between the different quintiles may be rather limited:

plot_quantile_returns_violin(mean_return_by_q_daily)
plt.tight_layout()

## Information Coefficient
# Most of this book is about the design of alpha factors using ML models. ML is about optimizing some predictive
# objective, and in this section, we will introduce the key metrics used to measure the performance of an alpha
# factor. We will define alpha as the average return in excess of a benchmark.
# This leads to the information ratio (IR) that measures the average excess return per unit of risk taken by dividing
# alpha by the tracking risk. When the benchmark is the risk-free rate, the IR corresponds to the well-known Sharpe
# ratio, and we will highlight crucial statistical measurement issues that arise in the typical case when returns are
# not normally distributed. We will also explain the fundamental law of active management that breaks the IR down into
# a combination of forecasting skill and a strategy's ability to effectively leverage the forecasting skills.

### 5D Information Coefficient (Rolling Average)
# The goal of alpha factors is the accurate directional prediction of future returns. Hence, a natural performance
# measure is the correlation between an alpha factor's predictions and the forward returns of the target assets.
# It is better to use the non-parametric Spearman rank correlation coefficient that measures how well the relationship
# between two variables can be described using a monotonic function, as opposed to the Pearson correlation that
# measures the strength of a linear relationship.
# We can obtain the information coefficient using alphalens, which relies on `scipy.stats.spearmanr` under the hood.
#
# The `factor_information_coefficient` function computes the period-wise correlation and plot_ic_ts creates a
# time-series plot with one-month moving average:
ic = factor_information_coefficient(alphalens_data)
plot_ic_ts(ic[["5D"]])
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig("images/06-04.png", bboxinches="tight")

### Information Coefficient by Holding Period
# This time series plot shows extended periods with significantly positive moving-average IC. An IC of 0.05 or
# even 0.1 allows for significant outperformance if there are sufficient opportunities to apply this forecasting
# skill, as the fundamental law of active management will illustrate:
# A plot of the annual mean IC highlights how the factor's performance was historically uneven:
ic = factor_information_coefficient(alphalens_data)
ic_by_year = ic.resample("A").mean()
ic_by_year.index = ic_by_year.index.year
ic_by_year.plot.bar(figsize=(14, 6))
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig("images/06-05.png", bboxinches="tight")

## Turnover Tear Sheet
# Factor turnover measures how frequently the assets associated with a given quantile change, that is, how many
# trades are required to adjust a portfolio to the sequence of signals. More specifically, it measures the share
# of assets currently in a factor quantile that was not in that quantile in the last period.
